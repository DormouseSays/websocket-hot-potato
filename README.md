# Hot Potato
A multiplayer in-person game where players pass a potato around the circle until it explodes.

The game starts in a waiting state as players join and set their status to ready. When all players are ready any one can push the 'start' button to start the game. They become player 1, going clockwise from them eac player taps next to set their position in the circle. Once they're all set, the game starts.

The first player starts with the potato and swipes right or left to pass it that way. Maybe you can only reverse direction a few times per round? When the potato explodes that player loses. They are the starting player for the next round.

Scoring: 1 point for every time the potato comes to you. Lose all your points if it explodes on you.
